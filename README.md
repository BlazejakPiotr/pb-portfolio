# Sample Portfolio and Blog Application

This is public version of my own portfolio website.

## Getting Started

First, get code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlazejakPiotr/pb-portfolio.git
```

then, instal node modules:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
